      <p>
        EARTH DRAGON is the alias used by myself, Dillon Stan, for my musical efforts.
        I am half chinese, and my alias comes from the literal translation of my chinese name, 地龙, pronounced De lóng.
        I've been interested in music since I was a child, and I was surrounded by many family members with their own musical interests or talents.
        I became profoundly inspired by electronic dance music around 2011-2012, as the sounds I heard were extraordinary and awe inspiring, but I've also been influenced by rap and most of my beats are not of the EDM genre.
        In april of 2014, I installed a digital audio workstation on my computer, and so far I've made some compositions that I enjoy.
        Lately, it has been a little more difficult for me to find the time or inspiration to create and refine original pieces, though I often have ideas to mix different songs together.
        On the portfolio page of this website, you will find what I consider to be some of my best work.
        I should probably turn down the bass just a little on some of these beats, but I'm not currently playing on big sound systems so clipping isn't really an issue at the moment.
